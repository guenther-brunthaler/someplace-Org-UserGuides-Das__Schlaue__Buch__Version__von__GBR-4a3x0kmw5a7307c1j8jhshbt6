"Probability density function" (PDF): The typical "bell curve" in case of the normal distribution. y shows how probable a specific sample value x is. (For the "standard" normal distribution x needs to be normalized such that its average is 0 and its standard deviation is 1, which can be achieved by by (x - mean) / stddev substituting the original x, where stddev is the square root of the variance, and variance is the mean of squared differences of y's from y's mean).

"Cumulative distribution function" (CDF): Looks like a rising flank with rounded edges. y represents the area of the PDF of 0 and the PDF of x. The y for a positive x therefore shows how probable it is that a sample value is x or larger. Like the PDF, the CDF is defined for a specific mean and variance, or a "standard" version with fixed average of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 may be used.
