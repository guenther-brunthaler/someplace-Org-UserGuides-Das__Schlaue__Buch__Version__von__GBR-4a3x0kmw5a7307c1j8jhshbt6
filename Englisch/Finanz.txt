* Verrechnungskonto: "clearing account", "settlement account"

Clearing is the process of sending out, reconciling and in some cases confirming payment orders or security transfer prior to settlement.

Settlement is the act of transferring ‘securities and final funds’ between two parties.

In simple words, clearing is the process of determining the obligations – who owes what to whom, and settlement is the process of actually fulfilling those obligations.
