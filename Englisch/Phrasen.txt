"Each Other" vs. "One Another"

Both terms are regarded synonyms by many people.

The phrase "each other" is known as a reciprocal pronoun because it shows a bidirectional action. For example, if Bill and Ted are being excellent to each other, that means Bill is being excellent to Ted, and Ted is being excellent to Bill. They're practicing what you might call excellence reciprocity.

But Bill and Ted aren't talking about being excellent just to Bill and Ted; they want each person in the world to be excellent to every other person. According to some grammarians, if we're talking about more than just two people, we should use a different reciprocal pronoun: one another. In other words, Bill and Ted should more properly have said, "Be excellent to one another."

Not even close!

This is an expression used to indicate that a statement that is not anywhere near the truth (or) a performance is not anywhere near to what is required (or) a statistic that is not anywhere near the truth. For e.g.

(1) Your answer to the question on the number of bones in a human body is not even close.

(2) John surpassed Jim in the 100 metres sprint; Jim's timing was not even close.

(3) Rachel's outsmarted Cindy in the dance. Cindy was not even close.

If you just want to tell somebody that their statement is wrong, then tell it in style - tell them they are "Not Even Close."
